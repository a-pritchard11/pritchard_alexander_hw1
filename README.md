<h1>Qu3nch!</h1>

<p>Within this repo, I have created a small webpage making use of typography techniques learned in class.</p>

<p>The Github repo has been created and added to as follows:
    1. Initial commit. The files of the completed assignment have been added. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assets folder</li>
<li>CSS folder and CSS files</li>
<li>Javascript folder and the base js file</li>
<li>Images folder and all images</li>
<li>The index.html file</li>
<li>The Gitignore file</li>
<li>The required Gitkeep files</li>
<li>The MIT Liscense that was automatically created along with the Github repo</li>
<li>This README file</li>
</ul>

<p>This will likely be the only commit, as all necessary files have been included and all of the work has already been completed.</p>
